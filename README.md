## 📌 About the Project

This repository contains an IoT monitoring platform designed to manage connected devices and sensors across classrooms. The application delivers real-time dashboards, configurable alerting, and an administrative experience that showcases modern Laravel engineering practices: a layered domain architecture, SOLID-compliant services, and an event-driven design that keeps the codebase extensible.

### Highlights
- 🛰️ **Device & Sensor Management** – register, classify, and monitor IoT hardware by classroom or type.
- 📈 **Real-Time Dashboard** – live metrics and charts powered by Pusher Channels and Chart.js.
- 🚨 **Rule-Based Alerting** – configurable thresholds, severity levels, and automated danger notifications via email.
- 🔐 **Role-Aware Access Control** – Laravel Sanctum API tokens, admin middleware, and fine-grained dashboards.
- 🧪 **Confidence in Code** – feature and unit tests covering alert workflows, email delivery, and dashboard metrics.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Clean MVC + Domain Layering
The platform follows Laravel’s MVC conventions while introducing dedicated **Domain Services**, **Observers**, and **Event/Listener** pipelines to keep business rules isolated from controllers and views.

- **Presentation Layer:** Blade templates and Tailwind/Bootstrap components under `resources/views`.
- **Application Layer:** REST controllers in `app/Http/Controllers`, form validation, Sanctum guards, and middleware.
- **Domain Layer:** Business logic encapsulated in services (`app/Services`), observers (`app/Observers`), and domain events (`app/Events`).
- **Infrastructure Layer:** Eloquent models (`app/Models`), database migrations, factories, and seeders.

### Directory Structure at a Glance

## 🧭 SOLID Principles in Practice

| Principle | Implementation | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| **Single Responsibility** | Domain services (`DashboardMetricsService`, `DeviceService`) encapsulate business rules; observers manage side effects. | Future work: extract email delivery from `Alert` model into a dedicated notification service. |
| **Open/Closed** | Event-driven architecture (model observers, broadcast events) allows new behaviors without touching existing classes. | Enhancement path: introduce alert strategies for custom rule types. |
| **Liskov Substitution** | Controllers and models extend Laravel bases without breaking contracts. | Fully compliant. |
| **Interface Segregation** | Traits (`HasFactory`, `Notifiable`) provide focused capabilities. | Next step: add service interfaces to maximize testability and swapability. |
| **Dependency Inversion** | Constructor injection and service providers decouple controllers from concrete implementations. | Evolution: adopt repository interfaces for persistence boundaries. |

**SOLID Score:** 7/10 — strong foundation with a clear roadmap to full decoupling.

## ⚙️ Core Features

### Device & Sensor Lifecycle
- CRUD for devices, types, classrooms, sensors, and sensor types.
- Device activation toggles, API key provisioning, MAC/IP tracking, last communication timestamps.
- User-specific dashboard preferences via `DashboardPreference`.

### Real-Time Monitoring
- WebSocket broadcasting (`App\Events\NewSensorReading`) to Pusher Channels.
- Live charts and alert counters powered by Chart.js and lightweight-charts.
- Personalized monitors persisted per user.

### Alert Engine
- Configurable rules scoped to sensor types, devices, or individual sensors.
- Severity levels (`info`, `warning`, `danger`) with danger-level email escalation.
- Observers (`SensorReadingObserver`, `AlertObserver`) trigger automated workflows.
- Alert history management, bulk resolution, and unresolved counters in the UI.

### Security & Access Control
- Laravel Auth with Sanctum tokens for API authentication.
- Middleware-based role enforcement (`EnsureUserIsAdmin`).
- API key validation for IoT device ingestion.
- Comprehensive request validation and structured logging.

### Testing
- **Feature tests:** alert email workflows, admin access policies, CRUD cases.
- **Unit tests:** dashboard metrics aggregation, alert evaluation logic.
- Factories + seeders provide rich fixtures for demos and CI pipelines.

## 📦 API Overview

- `POST /api/sensors/{sensor}/readings` – ingest sensor values (API key protected).
- `GET /api/devices` – list devices with status and metadata.
- `GET /api/sensors/{sensor}/latest-readings` – retrieve rolling sensor data.
- `GET /api/alerts/active` – expose current alert counts for dashboards.
- `POST /api/alert-rules/store` – register new alert rules programmatically.

All endpoints leverage Sanctum guards, API key validation, and rich validation responses so hardware agents and partner systems can integrate securely.

## 📚 Roadmap

- Extract alert evaluation into strategy classes for richer rule types.
- Introduce repository interfaces and DTOs for clearer domain boundaries.
- Expand notification channels (SMS, Slack) via a `NotificationChannel` interface.
- Publish OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for REST endpoints.
- Increase automated coverage across API and personalization flows.
